<h2>About Ku'uleilani</h2>

<p>As a young lady on the island of Oahu, Ku'uleilani was taught by her grandmother the ancient art form of lomi lomi (Hawaiian massage). While living on the East Coast, she earned her massage therapy license and was given the opportunity to teach lomi lomi in New Jersey.

Ku'uleilani has 10 years of professional massage experience and is accredited with working with professional athletes and celebrities.

As a proud Hawaiian, Ku'uleilani feels blessed to meet such amazing people and to share this unique art form called lomi lomi with all who enter her spa.
