<p>I had a great experience at Ku'uleilani day spa! 

I parked at Ala Moana, which was free, and only a couple blocks away, so not too bad. It was a little difficult to find. It's in the old Pan Am building. Take the elevator to the second floor. When you get there go left, and walk out the double glass doors into what looks like a parking garage, but there's a hallway down to the annex. You will see a hair salon, and its right next to it. I was a little apprehensive when I walked in, it was quiet, and to area seemed small at first glance. 

The owner greeted me write away and asked me if I wanted some water or tea. Than I filled out a medical waiver. She led me to the room in the back, and the area turned out to be pretty big with lots of rooms in the back. 

The massage was heavenly. The owner asked me if the pressure was too much or too little, and she didn't talk too much, which was nice. She told me the problem areas in my back, and spent extra time on those irritating knots I had. The hot stones were amazing.

Next was the best part, the facial! She asked me if I wanted rose, lavendar, or eucalyptus. I picked the eucalyptus, which was perfect. The creams and exfoliating stuff felt incredible! During the facial, she put this steamer machine near my face, and at first it kind of smelled like burning, and was a little uncomfortable, but it was really nice once I got used to it. 

The brown foot scrub was really like an add-on, it seemed nice, but wasn't the highlight for me. 

After everything, I hung out in the seating area, and had some chocolate and lemon water. I was also impressed that I didn't feel sticky or sweaty, or anything when I was walking out.
